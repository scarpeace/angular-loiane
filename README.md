## ðŸ’» Course

Loiane must be the best teacher of all times when it comes to patiently explaining how Angular works. This was by far the best free course i did and made me in love with Angular. During the course we developed a lot of small projects while talking about each Angular component separetly. By far the most challenging ones were the Forms projects, but the magic of video-classes is that you can go back and foward how many times you want. I highly recommend this course for any portuguese speaking person that wants to learn all the main funtionalities of Angular.
